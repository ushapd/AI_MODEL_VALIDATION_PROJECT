# AI_MODEL_VALIDATION_PROJECT

The Heart Failure Prediction Synthetic Dataset on Kaggle contains 10,000 rows and 20 columns, representing patient health metrics and outcomes related to heart failure. citeturn0search0 As a synthetic dataset, it is generated to simulate real-world data while avoiding privacy concerns associated with actual patient information.

Synthetic datasets like this are valuable for developing and testing machine learning models, especially when access to real medical data is limited. However, it's important to note that synthetic data may not capture all the nuances of real-world data, which can impact the generalizability of models trained solely on such data.

For a more comprehensive analysis, you might consider comparing this synthetic dataset with real-world datasets, such as the Heart Failure Prediction Dataset citeturn0search1 or the Heart Failure Clinical Data citeturn0search3, both available on Kaggle. This approach can help you assess the performance and robustness of your predictive models across different data sources. 

Agenda for this project:

To find missing values in the Heart Failure Prediction Synthetic Dataset, follow these steps:

Download the dataset from Kaggle.

Load the dataset into Python using pandas.

Check for missing values using .isnull().sum().

After Data preprocessing, validating , and analysing the data we prepare it for training using the libraries pandas, numpy,sci-kit for cleaning ,preprocessing and validating the data.
I implemented ML algorithms such as random forest and xgboost for feature engineering and to train the data.
